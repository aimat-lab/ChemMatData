# Overview over chemical datasets

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Our main goal is to create a collaborative platform
where we can gather and categorize various datasets,
making them conveniently accessible in one place.
We are actively collecting datasets for molecules as well as crystalline structures to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers, scientists, and enthusiasts.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
