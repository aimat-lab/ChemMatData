<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Our main goal is to create a collaborative platform
where we can gather and categorize various datasets,
making them conveniently accessible in one place.
We are actively collecting datasets for molecules as well as crystalline structures to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers, scientists, and enthusiasts.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

If you have additional datasets that you believe should be included in our repository,
we encourage you to contribute by creating a pull request. Here's how you can do it:

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Dataset / Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingDataset`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingDataset'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingDataset`)
5. Open a Pull Request

Alternatively, please send a link to a missing dataset to Jana (jana.zeller@student.kit.edu) and Pascal (pascal.friederich@kit.edu).

We appreciate your contribution and look forward to incorporating your suggested datasets into our growing collection!
