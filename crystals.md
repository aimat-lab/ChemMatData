# Overview of Crystal Datasets

Here is a curated list of crystal datasets along with their respective domains, task and crystal counts, task type (classification or regression), and whether the dataset includes geometry.
In cases where the dataset does not provide geometry, SMILES data is linked where available.

| Dataset Name | Domain | Short Description | #Tasks | #Compounds | Task Type | Data Type | Link | Paper |
