# Overview of Molecule Datasets

Here is a curated list of molecule datasets along with their respective domains, task and molecule counts, task type (classification or regression), and whether the dataset includes geometry.
In cases where the dataset does not provide geometry, SMILES data is linked where available.


| Dataset Name | Domain | Short Description | #Tasks | #Compounds | Task Type | Data Type | Link | Paper |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| QM9 |Quantum Mechanics|QM9 is a comprehensive dataset that provides geometric, energetic, electronic and thermodynamic properties for a subset of GDB-17 database,43 comprising 134 thousand stable organic molecules with up to nine heavy atoms. All molecules are modeled using density functional theory (B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) based DFT)| 16 | ~134,000 | `Regression` | SMILES, 3D coordinates | [figshare](http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/#:~:text=Available%20via-,figshare,-.) | [Enumeration of 166 billion organic small molecules in the chemical universe database GDB-17](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci300415d), [Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules](http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/#:~:text=A.%20von%20Lilienfeld%2C-,Quantum%20chemistry%20structures%20and%20properties%20of%20134%20kilo%20molecules,-%2C%20Scientific%20Data) |

| Freesolv | Physical Chemistry | A collection of experimental and calculated hydration free energies for small molecules in water. The calculated values are derived from alchemical free energy calculations using molecular dynamics simulations. | 1 | 643 | `Regression` | SMILES | [MoleculeNet](https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1#:~:text=organic%20small%20molecules.-,FreeSolv,-%3A%20Experimental%20and%20calculated) | [FreeSolv: a database of experimental and calculated hydration free energies, with input files](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24928188/)
| PCQM4Mv2 | Quantum Mechanics | Based on the PubChemQC, we define a meaningful ML task of predicting DFT-calculated HOMO-LUMO energy gap of molecules given their 2D molecular graphs. The HOMO-LUMO gap is one of the most practically-relevant quantum chemical properties of molecules since it is related to reactivity, photoexcitation, and charge transport. | 1 | 3,378,606 | `Regression` | SMILES | [website](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/lsc/pcqm4mv2/#dataset) | |
| Alchemy | Quantum Mechanics | The dataset comprises of 12 quantum mechanical properties of 119,487 organic molecules with up to 14 heavy atoms, sampled from the GDB MedChem database. | 12 | 202,579 | `Regression` | SMILES | [TUDatasets](https://chrsmrrs.github.io/datasets/docs/datasets/) | [Alchemy: A Quantum Chemistry Dataset for Benchmarking AI Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.09427.pdf)
