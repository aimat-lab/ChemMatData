# Overview of Molecule Datasets

Here is a curated list of molecule datasets along with their respective domains, task and molecule counts, task type (classification or regression), and whether the dataset includes geometry.
In cases where the dataset does not provide geometry, SMILES data is linked where available.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| QM9 |Quantum Mechanics|QM9 is a comprehensive dataset that provides geometric, energetic, electronic and thermodynamic properties for a subset of GDB-17 database,43 comprising 134 thousand stable organic molecules with up to nine heavy atoms. All molecules are modeled using density functional theory (B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) based DFT)| 16 | ~134,000 | `Regression` | SMILES, 3D coordinates | [figshare](http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/#:~:text=Available%20via-,figshare,-.) | [Enumeration of 166 billion organic small molecules in the chemical universe database GDB-17](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci300415d), [Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules](http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/#:~:text=A.%20von%20Lilienfeld%2C-,Quantum%20chemistry%20structures%20and%20properties%20of%20134%20kilo%20molecules,-%2C%20Scientific%20Data) |
| PCQM4Mv2 | Quantum Mechanics | Based on the PubChemQC, we define a meaningful ML task of predicting DFT-calculated HOMO-LUMO energy gap of molecules given their 2D molecular graphs. The HOMO-LUMO gap is one of the most practically-relevant quantum chemical properties of molecules since it is related to reactivity, photoexcitation, and charge transport. | 1 | 3,378,606 | `Regression` | SMILES | [website](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/lsc/pcqm4mv2/#dataset) | |
