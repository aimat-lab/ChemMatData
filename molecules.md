| QM9 |Quantum Mechanics|QM9 is a comprehensive dataset that provides geometric, energetic, electronic and thermodynamic properties for a subset of GDB-17 database,43 comprising 134 thousand stable organic molecules with up to nine heavy atoms. All molecules are modeled using density functional theory (B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) based DFT)| 16 | ~134,000 | `Regression` | Yes | [figshare](http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/#:~:text=Available%20via-,figshare,-.) | [Enumeration of 166 billion organic small molecules in the chemical universe database GDB-17](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci300415d), [Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules](http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/#:~:text=A.%20von%20Lilienfeld%2C-,Quantum%20chemistry%20structures%20and%20properties%20of%20134%20kilo%20molecules,-%2C%20Scientific%20Data) |

PCQM4Mv2 | Quantum Mechanics | Based on the PubChemQC, we define a meaningful ML task of predicting DFT-calculated HOMO-LUMO energy gap of molecules given their 2D molecular graphs. The HOMO-LUMO gap is one of the most practically-relevant quantum chemical properties of molecules since it is related to reactivity, photoexcitation, and charge transport. | 1 | 3,378,606 | `Regression` | [website](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/lsc/pcqm4mv2/#dataset) | |
Alchemy | Quantum Chemistry | The dataset comprises of 12 quantum mechanical properties of 119,487 organic
